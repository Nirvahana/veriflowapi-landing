# Data Sources

VeriflowAPI aggregates and normalizes data from multiple authoritative government sources. This page explains what each source covers, how frequently data is refreshed, and what happens when a source is temporarily unavailable.

## Federal Sources

These sources are checked on every verification request regardless of state.

### NPPES NPI Registry

The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System is the federal database of all healthcare providers who have been assigned a National Provider Identifier.

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Coverage | All 50 US states |
| Data includes | Name, NPI, taxonomy, practice address, credential status |
| Refresh frequency | Daily bulk download |
| Cache TTL | 24 hours |
| Managed by | Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) |

The NPPES database is the foundation of every verification. Even when a state board is temporarily unavailable, NPI data ensures you always receive a meaningful baseline response.

### OIG Exclusion List

The Office of Inspector General maintains a list of individuals and entities excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.). Hiring or contracting with an excluded provider can result in significant civil penalties.

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Coverage | All 50 US states |
| Data includes | Name, NPI, exclusion type, exclusion date, reinstatement date |
| Refresh frequency | Monthly official update, checked every 12 hours |
| Cache TTL | 12 hours |
| Managed by | HHS Office of Inspector General |

If `oig_excluded` is `true`, the provider must not be employed or contracted by any entity receiving federal healthcare funding. This is a hard disqualifier in most onboarding workflows.

## What happens when a source is down

Government websites experience downtime — planned maintenance, traffic spikes, infrastructure migrations. VeriflowAPI is architected to handle this gracefully.

When a source is unavailable during a request:

1. VeriflowAPI serves the most recent cached data for that source
2. The response includes `"source_live": false` and `"cached": true`
3. The `cache_expires_at` field tells you when fresh data will next be fetched
4. Our monitoring system detects the outage and begins retry attempts automatically

This approach ensures our 99.9% uptime SLA holds even when individual government sites experience extended downtime.

You can always check current source availability at **status.veriflowapi.com**.

## Remaining states

For the 45 states not in the Big 5, VeriflowAPI returns NPPES and OIG data which covers federal credential status. State-level license status for remaining states is on our roadmap.

If you have an urgent need for a specific state, email support@veriflowapi.com — we prioritize state additions based on customer demand.
