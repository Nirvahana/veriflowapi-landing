# HIPAA & Compliance

## Is VeriflowAPI HIPAA compliant?

VeriflowAPI is designed with healthcare compliance requirements in mind. We can sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with customers on our Scale and Enterprise plans.

**Important:** VeriflowAPI verifies license status from public government databases. We do not store or process Protected Health Information (PHI). The data we handle — names, NPIs, license numbers, and status — is publicly available information, not PHI.

That said, if your platform uses VeriflowAPI as part of a broader healthcare workflow, a BAA may still be required by your compliance team. We accommodate this.

## Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

A BAA is available for Scale and Enterprise plan customers.

To request a BAA, email **support@veriflowapi.com** with the subject line "BAA Request." We will respond within 2 business days.

## Data we store

| Data type | What we store | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| Verification requests | Input parameters (name, NPI, state) | 7 years |
| Verification results | Full response including sources checked | 7 years |
| Certificates | Signed verification certificates | 7 years |
| Webhook events | Event payload and delivery status | 1 year |
| API keys | Hashed key only, never plaintext | Until deleted |

We do not store payment card information. Billing is handled by Stripe.

## Data security

- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3
- Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256
- API keys are stored as one-way hashes — we cannot recover your key if lost
- Infrastructure is hosted on AWS with SOC 2 Type II certified data centers
- Access to production systems is restricted to essential personnel only

## SOC 2

VeriflowAPI is working toward SOC 2 Type II certification. Enterprise customers can request our current security documentation and controls summary by emailing support@veriflowapi.com.

## Data residency

All data is currently processed and stored in AWS US-East (Virginia). If your compliance requirements mandate a specific data residency, contact us to discuss options.

## Penetration testing

Enterprise customers may request permission to conduct penetration testing against VeriflowAPI. Contact support@veriflowapi.com at least 14 days in advance with your testing scope and schedule.
