# Rate Limits

VeriflowAPI enforces rate limits to ensure fair access and system stability for all customers.

## Monthly verification quotas

Each plan includes a monthly verification quota. This is the total number of `/v1/verify` calls you can make per billing month.

| Plan | Monthly verifications | Overage |
|---|---|---|
| Developer | 500 | Contact support |
| Production | 5,000 | $0.08 per additional check |
| Scale | 50,000 | $0.06 per additional check |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Included |

## Per-minute rate limits

In addition to monthly quotas, per-minute rate limits prevent burst traffic from affecting system stability.

| Plan | Requests per minute |
|---|---|
| Developer | 10 |
| Production | 60 |
| Scale | 300 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

## Rate limit headers

Every API response includes headers showing your current usage:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4873
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1740873600
X-RateLimit-Minute-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Minute-Remaining: 47
```

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Your monthly verification quota |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Verifications remaining this month |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when your monthly quota resets |
| `X-RateLimit-Minute-Limit` | Your per-minute limit |
| `X-RateLimit-Minute-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current minute |

## Handling rate limit errors

When you exceed your per-minute limit, you will receive a `429` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Per-minute rate limit exceeded. Your limit is 60 requests per minute.",
    "retry_after": 23
  }
}
```

The `retry_after` field tells you how many seconds to wait before retrying.

### Implementing retry logic — Python

```python
import requests
import time

def verify_with_retry(api_key, payload, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.post(
            "https://api.veriflowapi.com/v1/verify",
            headers={
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            json=payload
        )

        if response.status_code == 429:
            retry_after = response.json().get('error', {}).get('retry_after', 60)
            print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {retry_after} seconds...")
            time.sleep(retry_after)
            continue

        return response.json()

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Bulk verification

If you need to verify large batches of providers, use the bulk endpoint rather than making individual requests in a loop. This is more efficient and counts against your quota the same way.

```
POST https://api.veriflowapi.com/v1/verify/bulk
```

Accepts an array of up to 100 providers per request. Available on Production, Scale, and Enterprise plans.

```json
{
  "providers": [
    { "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Chen", "state": "CA", "npi": "1234567890" },
    { "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Park", "state": "TX", "npi": "0987654321" }
  ]
}
```
