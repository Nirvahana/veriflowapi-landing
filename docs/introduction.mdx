# Introduction

**VeriflowAPI** is a high-availability REST API for verifying professional licenses across fragmented US government databases. One API call replaces days of manual credentialing.

## What VeriflowAPI does

When you submit a provider's details, VeriflowAPI simultaneously checks:

- **NPPES NPI Registry** — federal database of all licensed healthcare providers
- **OIG Exclusion List** — HHS list of excluded individuals from federal programs
- **State Medical Boards** — real-time license status for CA, TX, NY, FL, and IL

We normalize inconsistent data formats across all sources and return a single, clean JSON response in under 200ms — even when government sites are slow or down.

## Who uses VeriflowAPI

- **Telehealth platforms** verifying providers before onboarding
- **Credentialing software** automating provider enrollment workflows
- **Healthcare staffing platforms** screening candidates at scale
- **Insurance and compliance teams** running periodic license audits
- **Medical staffing agencies** validating contractor credentials
