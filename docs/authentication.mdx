# Authentication

VeriflowAPI uses API keys to authenticate all requests. Your API key must be included in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Getting your API key

API keys are issued after your early access application is approved. You will receive your key via email from **support@veriflowapi.com**.

## Using your API key

Include your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer vf_live_your_api_key_here
```

### Example request with authentication

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.veriflowapi.com/v1/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vf_live_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "Sarah",
    "last_name": "Chen",
    "state": "CA",
    "npi": "1234567890"
  }'
```

## API key types

| Key prefix | Environment | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `vf_live_` | Production | Real verification requests |
| `vf_test_` | Sandbox | Testing and development |

Always use your **test key** during development. Test keys return realistic mock responses without consuming your monthly verification quota.

## Keeping your API key secure

- Never expose your API key in client-side code, public repositories, or frontend JavaScript
- Store keys in environment variables, not hardcoded in source code
- If you believe your key has been compromised, contact support@veriflowapi.com immediately for a replacement

## Authentication errors

If your API key is missing, invalid, or expired, you will receive a `401` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "authentication_failed",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API key. Include your key as: Authorization: Bearer vf_live_...",
    "docs": "https://docs.veriflowapi.com/authentication"
  }
}
```
