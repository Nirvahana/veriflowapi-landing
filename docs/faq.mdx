# FAQ

## General

### What professions does VeriflowAPI currently support?

VeriflowAPI currently supports medical doctors (MD and DO) in all 50 US states via NPPES and OIG, with deep state-level data for California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois.

Nursing, pharmacy, mental health practitioners, and contractor licenses are in development. Email support@veriflowapi.com to request priority support for a specific profession.

### How accurate is VeriflowAPI?

VeriflowAPI pulls directly from authoritative government databases — NPPES, OIG, and state medical boards. Accuracy is as good as the source data. We normalize and validate data on ingestion to reduce errors from inconsistent source formatting.

For high-stakes decisions, we recommend using both NPI and DOB in your request to maximize match accuracy.

### Can VeriflowAPI verify providers in all 50 states?

Yes, for basic NPI and OIG screening. For full state-level license status — including expiry date and disciplinary history — we currently support the Big 5 states: California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois. Additional states are being added based on customer demand.

### Do you support international license verification?

Not currently. VeriflowAPI is focused on the US market. Canada and UK are on the roadmap for 2027.

## Technical

### What happens if a government site is down?

VeriflowAPI serves cached data when a source is temporarily unavailable. The response will include `"cached": true` and `"source_live": false`. The `cache_expires_at` field tells you when fresh data will next be attempted.

Our 99.9% uptime SLA covers our API availability, not the availability of individual government source sites.

### How do I know if my result is from cache or live?

Check the `cached` and `source_live` fields in the response:

```json
{
  "source_live": false,
  "cached": true,
  "cache_expires_at": "2026-02-21T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### What does `verified: false` mean exactly?

`verified: false` means one of the following:

- Provider was not found in any checked sources (`status: "not_found"`)
- License status is not active (`status: "inactive"`, `"suspended"`, `"expired"`, or `"revoked"`)
- Provider is on the OIG exclusion list (`oig_excluded: true`)

Always check the `status` and `oig_excluded` fields for the specific reason.

### Can I use VeriflowAPI for non-medical professions?

Not yet. Medical doctors are the current focus. Nursing, pharmacy, legal, and contractor licenses are in active development.

### What is the difference between `disciplinary_flags` and `oig_excluded`?

- `disciplinary_flags: true` means the provider has disciplinary actions on record with their state medical board. This could be a warning, probation, or other board action. It is a signal that requires human review — not necessarily a disqualifier.
- `oig_excluded: true` means the provider is on the federal HHS exclusion list. This is a hard disqualifier. You cannot employ or contract with this provider if you receive federal healthcare funding (Medicare, Medicaid).

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?

Yes, at any time. Plan changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

### What happens if I exceed my monthly quota?

VeriflowAPI handles publicly available government data, not Protected Health Information (PHI). However, we can sign a BAA for Scale and Enterprise customers who require it as part of their compliance framework. See our [Compliance](/compliance) page for full details.

### How long do you retain verification records?

All verification records and certificates are retained for 7 years from the date of issue, in line with standard healthcare compliance record retention requirements.
